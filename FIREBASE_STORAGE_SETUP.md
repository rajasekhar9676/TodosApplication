# File Storage Setup Guide

## ✅ Using Firestore Database (No Premium Required!)

Your project now uses **Firestore Database** for file storage instead of Firebase Storage, which means:
- ✅ **No premium subscription required**
- ✅ **Uses your existing Firestore setup**
- ✅ **No CORS issues**
- ✅ **Immediate file viewing**

### Current Setup
- **Storage**: Firestore Database (`fileStorage` collection)
- **Format**: Base64 encoded files
- **Max File Size**: 1GB per file (supports large documents)
- **Authentication**: Uses existing Firestore auth

### Test File Upload
1. Go to organize section in your app
2. Try uploading a file using the new bulk upload feature
3. Files will be stored in Firestore and viewable immediately

## Storage Rules (Already Updated)

The storage rules have been updated to allow uploads to the `org/` path:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow authenticated users to read and write files in organize section
    match /org/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Other existing rules...
  }
}
```

## Features After Setup

✅ **File Upload**: Single and bulk file uploads
✅ **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress
✅ **File Management**: View, download, delete files
✅ **Large Files**: Up to 100MB per file
✅ **Bulk Upload**: Up to 20 files at once
✅ **Offline Support**: Cached files work offline
✅ **Long-term Storage**: Files stored in Firebase Storage

## Troubleshooting

### CORS Errors
- Make sure Firebase Storage is enabled
- Check that storage rules are deployed
- Verify user is authenticated

### Upload Failures
- Check file size (max 100MB)
- Verify file type is supported
- Check browser console for errors

### Performance Issues
- Large files are cached locally for faster access
- Use bulk upload for multiple files
- Consider file compression for very large files

## Cost Considerations

- **Firebase Storage**: Pay per GB stored and downloaded
- **Free Tier**: 5GB storage, 1GB/day downloads
- **Pricing**: Very affordable for most use cases

## Security

- Files are only accessible to authenticated users
- Each file has a unique path to prevent conflicts
- Metadata is cached locally for performance
