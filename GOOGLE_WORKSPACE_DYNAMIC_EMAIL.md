# 🏢 Google Workspace Dynamic Email System

## 📋 Overview

This guide explains how to implement **true dynamic email sending** for Google Workspace accounts (like `itteam@educationtoday.co`). Unlike regular Gmail, Google Workspace has domain restrictions but offers powerful business email capabilities.

## 🔍 **Why Your Emails Come from `itteam@educationtoday.co`**

### **Root Cause:**
- **You're using Google Workspace** with domain `educationtoday.co`
- **`itteam@educationtoday.co`** is your authenticated business email
- **Google Workspace has domain restrictions** for email sending
- **Cannot send from arbitrary email addresses** outside your domain

### **Current Behavior:**
```
From: itteam@educationtoday.co (your business email)
To: teammate@company.com
Subject: Invitation to join Team Krish
```

### **Desired Behavior:**
```
From: john@educationtoday.co (team member's email)
To: teammate@company.com  
Subject: Invitation to join Team Krish
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Updated Gmail Service:**

```typescript
// Detect Google Workspace accounts
if (this.credentials.senderEmail.includes('@') && 
    !this.credentials.senderEmail.endsWith('@gmail.com')) {
  this.credentials.isGoogleWorkspace = true;
  this.credentials.domain = this.credentials.senderEmail.split('@')[1];
}

// Create domain-specific email addresses
createDynamicEmailAddress(userEmail: string, teamName: string): string {
  if (this.credentials.isGoogleWorkspace) {
    const domain = this.credentials.domain;
    const username = userEmail.split('@')[0];
    return `${username}.team@${domain}`;
  }
  return userEmail;
}
```

### **Dynamic Email Flow:**

1. **User Authentication**
   - System detects Google Workspace account
   - Identifies domain restrictions

2. **Email Address Generation**
   - Creates domain-compliant email addresses
   - Uses SendAs or alias addresses

3. **Dynamic Sending**
   - Sends from appropriate team member address
   - Maintains domain compliance
